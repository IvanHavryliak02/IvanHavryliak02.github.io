# TeaPass

**TeaPass** is a copy of a real existing website, created as a practice project to improve my front-end development skills.  
The main focus of this project was to build a **custom slider** â€” both the layout and the slider script were fully developed by me.

---

## Project Goal

The purpose of this project was to practice and understand how to create sliders **from scratch**, without relying on third-party libraries.  
This project helped me deepen my knowledge of layout structure, animation logic, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**
