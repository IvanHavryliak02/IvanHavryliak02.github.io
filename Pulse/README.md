# Pulse

**Pulse** is a landing page created as my first practical project using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## Features

- A responsive **slider** built with the **Slick-slider** library.  
- **Tabs** for simple and structured content navigation.  
- Integrated **Google Maps** section.  
- A **contact form** with input validation and email submission — messages are sent directly to the manager’s email via **Mailer**.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to practice and strengthen my skills in building web layouts and working with interactive elements.  
It served as my first real experience combining markup, styling, and JavaScript interactivity in a complete landing page project.
