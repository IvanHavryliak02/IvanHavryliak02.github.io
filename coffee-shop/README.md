# ☕ Coffee Shop

**Coffee Shop** is my **first self-built React project**, created while learning the fundamentals of the framework.  
During development, I explored key React concepts such as **state**, **props**, **components**, and practiced **lifting state up** and **passing events down** between components.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React (SPA)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 / CSS3 (responsive design)**

## 📋 Project Description

**Coffee Shop** is a single-page application featuring a **catalog of coffee products** with **search and filtering** functionality.  
The interface is divided into **interactive sections** that can **change their configuration** or **show/hide** dynamically based on user actions.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of how data flows in React and how to build reusable, well-structured UI components.
