# ðŸ’¼ Portfolio

Hello! My name is **Ivan**, and Iâ€™m a **Front-End Web Developer**.  
This repository contains my personal **portfolio projects** â€” each with its own detailed description inside the corresponding projectâ€™s README file.

## ðŸ§­ About This Repository

- Each folder in this repository represents an **individual project**.  
- To explore a project in detail, open its folder and read the included **README.md**.  
- If youâ€™d like to look at the **source code**, please open the **`src`** directory inside each project.  
  The **`dist`** folder contains the code processed by a build tool â€” itâ€™s often **minified**, **restructured**, and may not be easy to read.  
- Some projects are built with **Vite**, which may introduce additional generated code that doesnâ€™t represent my original source.

## ðŸ™Œ Final Note

I hope my projects **inspire**, **entertain**, or maybe even **surprise** you.  
Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
